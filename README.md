# NBA Betting Statistics App

## Purpose
The purpose of this application is to consume API's that provide historical NBA statistics and use them to find trends and predict future outcomes for betting on NBA games. 

## Tech Stack
Ruby on Rails
PostgreSQL

## Issues
Originally I wanted to use APIs to display the data, but I could not find a free resource to do so. Instead I have started looking into free CSV files, which would provide me with all of the historical data that I need.
